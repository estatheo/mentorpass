## Check In

1. Connect with your mentor and let him know you're a mentorpass member.
2. On your mobile, log in to the Mentorpass app and go to Check In (enable internet)
3. The mentor will book your session based on availability.

## Session Token

Alternatively, you can use the session token - a 10-digit number that you send to the mentor for a lightning session. Please note, you can use your Session Token to book short session on a walk-in basis. See specific mentor pages for more details.



### Get your Session Token on our website or the Mentorpass app.
