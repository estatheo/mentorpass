  title: Why Mentorpass?
  description: >-
    We belive Mentors are great assets for professionals looking to develop
    their careers. They help you find opportunities to stimulate your personal
    and professional growth as they draw from their own experiences. It is also
    beneficial to see how they became successful and understand their
    perspective on professional development. They become your trusted advisor
    and help guide and give you insights on instances you may not see yourself.

  Mentorship makes a notable difference and builds a better, more knowledgeable
  workforce, it advances careers. When experienced professionals choose to
  mentor someone newer to the workforce, they can boost people who may not
  otherwise have those opportunities and help level the playing field.

        We believe that everyone can be a leader and that true leadership is
        earned through our actions, not given with our titles. And we support
        the process of becoming a valued member of the community.

    Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
    java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
    production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
    knowledge to anyone. This is an edit via identity...

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
